Be aware that this process will take a few minutes (~4 minutes) to be completed.

To deploy the service manually, run the following commands in order:

```bash
make init
make check # this will execute fmt, validate and plan
make apply
```

To destroy the service, run the following command:

```bash
make destroy
```
