# User Service

Service responsible to manage the users

# Local Development

## Requirements

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

## Manual deployment

### Attention

Before deploying the service, make sure to set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

Be aware that this process will take a few minutes (~4 minutes) to be completed.

To deploy the service manually, run the following commands in order:

```bash
make init
make check # this will execute fmt, validate and plan
make apply
```

To destroy the service, run the following command:

```bash
make destroy
```

## Automated deployment

The automated deployment is triggered by a GitHub Action.
